Refined sugar, artificial sweeteners, and chemical food additives, nutritional deficiencies, preservatives and food allergies are all causes of ADD/ADHD.

1. Fish Oil (1,000 milligrams daily)
Omega 3 supplements have been shown to benefit ADHD patients, as the EPA/DHA in fish oil are critical for brain function and are anti-inflammatory. Supplementation has been shown to reduce symptoms and improve learning.

2. B-Complex (50 milligrams daily)
Children with ADHD may need more B-vitamins to help with the formation of serotonin, especially vitamin B6.

3. Multi-Mineral Supplement (including zinc, magnesium and calcium)
I recommend that anyone with ADHD take 500 milligrams calcium, 250 milligrams of magnesium and 5 milligrams zinc twice daily.  All play a role in relaxing the nervous system and a deficiency may exacerbate symptoms.

4. Probiotic (25–50 billion units daily)
ADHD may be connected to digestive issues, therefore taking a good quality probiotic daily will help maintain intestinal health.

5. GABA (250 milligrams twice daily)
A calming amino acid, ask your doctor before taking GABA, as it can interact with other medications.

Bonus ADD/ADHD Remedy
Rhodiola Rosea has been proven effective at improving the focus of both adults and children. It works by increasing the sensitivity in the neurological and nervous system that produce serotonin and dopamine, which are both essential for effective ADHD symptom control.

According to a study conducted by Dr. Terry Friedmann, essential oils of vetiver and cedarwood are very effective in improving focus and calming down children with ADHD. (7)
For memory and concentration, rosemary and peppermint oils have been shown to improve alertness while enhancing memory.
For a calming effect, Ylang Ylang and lavender are effective, while frankincense brings emotional wellness, clarity and heightened cognitive function.

When I took psychedelics -- LSD and psilocybin -- in my 20s, I ended up with 35 years of very severe depression and anxiety.
So I'm warning people who are quite sensitive emotionally (and/or are already somewhat anxious and/or depressed) 
that the result of imbibing psychodelics may be that you become severely anxious and depressed and that this may last for a long time. 
The following is from an impartial website called -- drugsand dot me -- 
"During a bad trip, you might feel: Anxiety, Fear/panic, Dysphoria, Paranoia, Confusion, Disorientation, Unwanted thoughts, emotions and memories, 
Frightening perceptions, Distressing awareness of physiological processes, Feelings about evil forces/existential crisis, Headache". 
I had some "good" but actually more "bad" effects from these drugs, and I didn't take them under safe or controlled situations. 
The people I knew who had "positive" trips were all quite-repressed people. I will attempt to contact Michael Pollen about this.

Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability

Form CC-305
OMB Control Number 1250-0005
Expires 1/31/2020
Why are you being asked to complete this form?

Because we do business with the government, we must reach out to, hire, and provide equal opportunity to qualified people with disabilities(i). To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.

If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.
How do I know if I have a disability?

You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

Disabilities include, but are not limited to:

    Blindness
    Deafness
    Cancer
    Diabetes
    Epilepsy

    Autism

Joe, let me start by saying that your father and I are extremely unhappy with your performance as Power of Attorney. We made you POA so you could nurture and help this family, not rule it as a dictator.
You are not evicting Josh from this house ever. All of your proposals in your letter from your attorney are ridiculous. The way you are treating Josh is disgraceful. 
We love Josh just as much as you and David, and we need him here. We don’t care if you believe us or not, that is the truth. Your father and I will always stand up for Josh, no matter what.
You can call the sheriff 1000 times, and it will never do you any good, because we will always be there for him. Your father and I will not abide by your letter from your lawyer,
it is absolutely ridiculous. By the way, if you and David are living here at the house, and Josh can never come back to the house again, how is he supposed to get 1/3 trust?? This house IS the trust.



Dear Joe, I am writing you this letter to let you know that I don’t want to hear from you or see you, and you are not allowed to come to “The Lambert Family House” until you  abide by these requests.
1. If I need money, you need to give it to me without scrutinizing my life. You are acting like a money hungry dictator, and I cant take you treating us like children any longer.
I regret making you the Power of Attorney for this family, because you are not helping us, you are blatantly going against my and our wishes, which is horrible.
If I ask you for money, its because we need it. It is OUR money, not yours..
2. I am appalled and disgusted by your treatment of Josh. I will not let your petty personal differences destroy Joshs future, as it is apparent that you are trying to achieve that.
You are to change the trust as we have asked you, so Josh can get a lump sum of money up front, just like you and David. Nothing else is acceptable.
Your father and I may be incompetent in your eyes, but we are not too old to know what we want and what is best for the family.
Leave Josh alone so he can get on with his life. He is your brother. Just because he wont talk to you doesn’t make it right to destroy his future. Until you can abide by these requests, I don’t want to anything to do with you.
Sincerely, Mom

I accepted an offer on 2/10 for a 1-year contract at Accenture/Google.  It took them until 2/27 to get me all 6 forms to sign: code of conduct, NDA, etc.  Now the start date keeps on slipping.  No idea if this'll happen soon, or if the position or project is in limbo and they're hiding that.  On 3/04, I asked what's my start date, was told "the start date is still not clear, would appreciate if you can please wait for us to get a firm answer."  Would like some guidance.

I have many years of experience tutoring high school and college math, including Algebra 1.

I'd be happy to work with your daughter to figure out why she has been falling behind in math.  

There are quite a few reasons why students might struggle with math.  Maybe she has weak spots in her background that need addressing.  I helped students with issues with self-confidence in math, or even have math anxiety.  Some students have trouble organizing themselves when they work problems.  Occasionally, I've found students have learning disabilities that need to be addressed.








The way the Los Angeles police union assailed Mayor Eric Garcetti recently is interesting.  They stated "they've lost confidence in the mayor's ability to lead," accused him of “political pandering” and called him “unstable.”
This language assumes that the American public still trusts police.  But that trust was seriously eroded by video after video of George Floyd’s murder and apparent police mishandling of the resulting unrest.  Mayor Garcetti is acting on that erosion of public trust.
Police departments nationwide must earn the public's trust back.  I recommend they engage the American public as equals. I contend that insulting and threatening local politicians will only further erode that lack of trust, not bring it back.




Hi Ui-Jeen,

I have considerable experience with Python.  I've posted some of my Python programs online on GitHub.  Wyzant likes to block out URLs, so here’s the URL in all English:
https colon slash slash github dot com slash DavidJLambert slash Python-Universal-DB-Client.

I also have experience with Java, Fortran, Visual Basic, and shell scripting.

I have 15 years of experience as a tutor of math and software, and 10 years as a Technical Support Engineer.  I am very easy to understand, and quite patient.  I have a talent for understanding what my students need to know, and teaching them at their own pace.

I would be happy to teach your son Python.  There are quite a few excellent textbooks designed for children about your son's age.  They tend to be organized around constructing a variety of fun projects.  Together, he and I will look at a few, and pick one.  I'd then give him reading and programming assignments, and we would meet maybe 2 times per week for Q&A and review of his work.

What grades has he been getting in his math classes?  Math and programming ability tend to be correlated.

Hi Carla,
I'm familiar with Pickle, and really familiar with databases in Python.
I have considerable experience with Python and computer science.  My favorite development environments are PyCharm and PyDev.  I've posted some of my Python programs online on GitHub.  Wyzant likes to block out URLs, so here’s the URL in all English: github dot com slash DavidJLambert slash Python-Universal-DB-Client.
I also have experience with Java, Fortran, VBA, Visual Basic, and shell scripting.
I have 15 years of experience as a tutor of math and software, and 10 years as a Technical Support Engineer.  I have a talent for understanding what my students need to know, and teaching them at their own pace.
I have more than 10 years of experience with SQL, and with 6 types of relational databases: Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, and SQLite.
I have lots of experience installing, configuring, and administering these 6 types of databases on Windows and Linux.  I have sample databases of all 6 types available for you to use: Access and SQLite database files, and VirtualBox virtual machines with the other 4 types: Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
I also have 15 years of experience as a tutor, making me a patient, easy-to-understand teacher of technical subjects.  I excel at figuring out where my students are, then giving them the knowledge they need at a pace comfortable for them.
SQL can be a challenge for students.  It’s not a procedural language where you give the computer exact steps to follow.  In SQL, you tell the computer what results you want, and the computer figures out the quickest way to get your results.

Hi Michael,
I have 15 years of experience as a math tutor, and I've worked with students from middle school through college and beyond, covering topics from pre-algebra and algebra through calculus and linear algebra.
I've helped math students with a variety of difficulties, such as math anxiety, a tendency to make lots of mistakes on homework and tests, lack of confidence, and teachers and textbooks that are not so good.
I've been told I'm kind and really good at communicating with people at their own level. I'm also patient, happy to work with students at their own pace, and good at putting students at ease.
As a tutor, I usually explain a topic and show you an example or two.  Then I have you do an example or a homework problem, giving you hints to get you to the correct answer.  Think of me as your training wheels.

I can help you.  Most of my students on Wyzant are like you: they taking data science, and they're having trouble translating various ideas into Python.
